	<description>A mod to add in a scenario to the Gestalt Engine mod by Helixien.
Now, at first, it started as what was supposed to be an "easy" mod. Now, well...	there's a reason it's an Alpha!
	
	So, anyways, due to how much of a project this mod is, I couldn't have done it without help, so, 
Firstly, thank you Breadmond, for the idea, and pestering me when I forgot (: If it wasn't for you, this mod would never have been completed! (Also for testing it, and making a proto-type non-mod version)

	Without the idea, this wouldn't exist. Without the prototype, I would have had no idea where to even begin. Without the pestering, I would have stopped half way through

Next up, thank you to Nirahiel, without whom I couldn't have even begun to do the necessary C# code, nor realize that this mod would reqrire code! He described a good algorithim for the system, and the holography is based on his idea!

Finally, thank you Helixien for making the Gestalt Engine mod, without which this mod wouldn't be possible!

FAQ
Q: CE Compatible?
A: Uh... sure. There might be "unintented features" that we can't guarentee to fix, but you do you and all!
	Do note, I have heard that Gestalt Engine (the main reqrirment) is compatible.
	
Q: Why isn't it 1.4 compatible?
A: Once apon a time, it was. But so many changes occured, and the 1.4 version was effectivly empty, so it was decided the best option was to remove it.
