By makeing it require the mod which has the scenario in it, people with this mod will now still get the scenario (when applicable). Basicly (once I get the prototype working)
- install this mod: get scenario
- install my main mod and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3400713047]Reinforced Mechanoids 2[/url]: get scenario
