[h1]THIS MOD IS QUITE COMPLEX AND A MAJOR WORK IN PROGRESS[/h1]
That means:
[b][olist]
[*]Updates will be semi-sporiadic due to complexity and necessary brakes
[*]There will be very little "polish" (for instance, no preview image)
[*]For modders, ID's might change as I re-design the mod from scratch over and over...

[u]YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED[/u]

Okay, now that the warning is over let's get on with the mod description!

So, there is [i]one[/i] thing missing from our good friend the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042401691]Gestalt Engine Mod[/url]. That is: a scenario!

So, a while back, I mentioned "I'm beginning to get into modding, I'll look into it". I then forgot, luckilly the person who inspired it didin't. After a "few" reminders, I started working on it. First they uploaded a prototype scenario, which I used as a basis. I then started editing the scenario, by doing things such as adding background features to let it work better! So, anyways, thank you to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198366165786]Breadmond[/url], for:

[*]Inspiritation
[*]Testing
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3157511590]A prototype[/url]
[*]Pestering me to make sure I didin't forget (honestly, only sure-fire way to remind me)
